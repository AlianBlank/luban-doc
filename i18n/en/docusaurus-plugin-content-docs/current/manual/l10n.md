# localization

Multiple localization mechanisms are supported and they can be used simultaneously.


## Time localization

The datetime type data will output the UTC time at the corresponding time according to the target time zone, which is convenient for program use. The default time zone used is the local time zone. Specify the target time zone with the command line parameter `--timeZone`.

The time zone is the time zone name under linux or win, for example: -t "Asia/Shanghai" or -t "China Standard Time" specifies that the target time zone is Asia Shanghai (that is, Beijing time)

## text localization

Due to the wide range of localization requirements, the text type is specially provided to support the corresponding requirements. text is a special syntactic sugar, not an independent type. It is equivalent to `string#text=1`, that is, the string type containing the `text=1` tag.

The text semantically corresponds to the key of the localized string, and Luban will check the validity of this key in the data validator.

###ITextProvider

ITextProvider is used to provide a valid text mapping table so that TextValidator can check the validity of the localization key. Use `-x l10n.textProviderName=xxx` to specify that you use TextProvider, the default is `default`, for DefaultTextProvider. You can also implement your own TextProvider.

### DefaultTextProvider

DefaultTextProvider uses `-x l10n.textProviderFile=xxx` to specify the localized key-value file. DefaultTextProvider uses builtin DataLoader to read data in localization files.
DefaultTextProvider assumes a table format like this:

```xml
<bean name="TextInfo">
   <var name="key" type="string"/>
</bean>
<table name="TbTextInfo" value="TextInfo" input="xxx"/>
```

The key field name of the localization file is `key` by default, and `-x l10n.key=you_key` is also supported to specify the key field name.

The localization data file can be in excel format, json, xml and other formats, as long as it conforms to the format standard of Luban's builtin DataLoader (see [excel format] (excel) and [non-excel format] (otherdatasource) documents) That's it.
When using the json format, since it is impossible to put only one text data in a json file, in practice, the json file will contain a text list, which can be filled in the compound data file format (see [non-excel format](otherdatasource)). The following is a sample localized text table in json format, which is read into the text list by specifying `-x l10.textProviderFile=*@your_text_file.json`.
